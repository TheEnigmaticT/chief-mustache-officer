Making a new personal website finally. Why? Well, my old one was like 8 years old and built with Froala blocks. 

The Internet has come a bit of a way since then.

Creating this as a both a record of what I've been up to as well as a great place to monkey around with new tech and ideas. 

I'm not a developer, but I'll admin I'm learning to play one on TV. Part of the whole "AI Powered CMO" thing is that I need to get better at using AI to develop stuff. So let's talk about that.

## Tech Stack

I'm buildnig this at the moment with a combo of:

* Lovable.dev
* Gemini 2.5
* VSCode


The technologiis this project is built with:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS

But I'll be honest and I'm really only confident that I could do about 10% of this without the help of the AI.
